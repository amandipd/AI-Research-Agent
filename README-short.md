# API Rate Limit Manager

> ðŸš§ **Currently under development** - This project will be built once I learn Go, Redis, and distributed systems concepts.

A smart system that helps you manage API rate limits across multiple services without getting blocked or wasting quota.

## Overview

This system provides intelligent API rate limit management through:
- Smart request queuing and scheduling
- Optimized request distribution across time windows  
- Multi-API usage tracking (GitHub, Twitter, Stripe, etc.)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (for high performance)
- **Database**: Redis + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React dashboard
- **Queue**: Kafka for request processing

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/username/api-rate-limit-manager.git

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up
```

## Basic Usage

Send your API requests through the rate limiter instead of directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/request \
  -d '{
    "api": "github", 
    "endpoint": "/user/repos",
    "priority": 5
  }'
```

The system handles the rate limiting and executes your request when it's safe.
